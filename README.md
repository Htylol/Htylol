# 👋 Hello

I'm a junior developer currently learning C# and PostgreSQL, and I have some knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS.
I'm also gaining knowledge and experience in data structures and algorithms,
networking, system administration, system analysis, and graphic design.

## 😃 More about me

🧑💻 I'm usually contributing to open-source projects with translations, typo fixes or, hopefully in the future,
real code for them.

💬 You can ask me about anything; I'm always eager to learn more about the world
and might have an answer to your question (or not).

🐧 I love Linux and am part of its community, being most active around it.

🆓 Most software I use is free and open-source (FOSS), but I'm not a strict follower of that philosophy;
it is more of a simple preference.
