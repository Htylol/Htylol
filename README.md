# Hello 👋
I'm a back-end developer currently learning C#, SQL, and Python. I'm also acquiring knowledge and experience on data structures/algorithms, networking, system admnistration, system analysis, and graphic design.

## More about me 😃
🧑‍💻 I am usually contributing to less-known FOSS projects with translations or typo fixes or, hopefully in the future, writing real code for them.

💬 You can ask me about anything; I'm always eager to learn more about the world and might have an answer to your question (or not).

🐧 I love Linux and am part of its community, being most active around it.

🆓 Most of the apps I use are free and open-source (FOSS), but I'm not a strict follower of that philosophy; it's more of a simple preference.
